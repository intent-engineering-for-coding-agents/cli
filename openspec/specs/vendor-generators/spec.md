# vendor-generators Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change ase-init. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: --with-claude emits CLAUDE.md with @AGENTS.md import
The `--with-claude` flag on `ase init` SHALL create a `CLAUDE.md` file containing the `@AGENTS.md` import directive.

#### Scenario: Claude file created alongside init [VENDOR-001]

**Test:** Integration

- **WHEN** `ase init --with-claude` is run
- **THEN** `CLAUDE.md` is created in the target directory
- **AND** the file content is exactly `@AGENTS.md` followed by a newline

#### Scenario: Claude file not overwritten without --force [VENDOR-002]

**Test:** Integration

- **WHEN** `ase init --with-claude` is run and `CLAUDE.md` already exists
- **THEN** the existing `CLAUDE.md` is preserved
- **AND** a message indicates "CLAUDE.md already exists (use --force to overwrite)"

#### Scenario: Claude file with --force [VENDOR-003]

**Test:** Integration

- **WHEN** `ase init --with-claude --force` is run and `CLAUDE.md` already exists
- **THEN** `CLAUDE.md` is overwritten with fresh `@AGENTS.md` content

#### Scenario: --with-claude without init context [VENDOR-004]

**Test:** Integration

- **WHEN** `ase init --with-claude` is run in an already-initialized directory
- **THEN** only `CLAUDE.md` is created (directory scaffolding skipped)
- **AND** the vendor file is created even if init files already exist

### Requirement: --with-gemini emits .gemini/settings.json
The `--with-gemini` flag on `ase init` SHALL create a `.gemini/settings.json` file configured to read `AGENTS.md` as context.

#### Scenario: Gemini settings created alongside init [VENDOR-005]

**Test:** Integration

- **WHEN** `ase init --with-gemini` is run
- **THEN** `.gemini/settings.json` is created in the target directory
- **AND** the file contains `{"context": {"fileName": "AGENTS.md"}}` (formatted as JSON)

#### Scenario: Gemini settings not overwritten without --force [VENDOR-006]

**Test:** Integration

- **WHEN** `ase init --with-gemini` is run and `.gemini/settings.json` already exists
- **THEN** the existing file is preserved
- **AND** a message indicates ".gemini/settings.json already exists (use --force to overwrite)"

#### Scenario: Both vendor flags combined [VENDOR-007]

**Test:** Integration

- **WHEN** `ase init --with-claude --with-gemini` is run
- **THEN** both `CLAUDE.md` and `.gemini/settings.json` are created
- **AND** the directory scaffolding is also performed

#### Scenario: Vendor flags with --dry-run [VENDOR-008]

**Test:** Integration

- **WHEN** `ase init --with-claude --dry-run` is run
- **THEN** the output lists `CLAUDE.md` as a file that would be created
- **AND** no files are actually written
